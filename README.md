$wgWandaLLMModel = 'gemma:2b';
$wgWandaLLMApiKey = 'your-api-key-here'; // if required by provider
$wgWandaLLMApiEndpoint = 'http://localhost:11434/api/';
```

For detailed Wanda configuration, see the [Wanda extension documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Wanda).

### Real-time Spell Check

As you type, WandaScribe monitors your text and:
- Detects potential misspellings when you press space or punctuation
- Shows a popup with suggestions near the cursor
- Allows you to quickly correct mistakes

## Troubleshooting

### Panel doesn't appear
- Check that you're on an edit page (action=edit)
- Verify Wanda extension is installed and loaded
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### "Wanda not available" error
- Ensure Wanda extension is installed: `Special:Version`
- Check Wanda configuration in `LocalSettings.php`
- Verify LLM provider is properly configured

### No suggestions or errors
- Check Wanda's LLM configuration
- Test Wanda's chat feature at `Special:Wanda`
- Review MediaWiki debug logs

### Slow performance
- Adjust LLM timeout settings in Wanda config
- Use a faster LLM model
- Consider using a local Ollama instance

## Privacy and Security

- All text processing is done through the Wanda extension's LLM integration
- Data is sent to the configured LLM provider (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
- For sensitive wikis, use self-hosted Ollama to keep data private
- No text is stored by WandaScribe itself

## Limitations

- Requires Wanda extension to be installed and configured
- Performance depends on the LLM provider's speed
- Quality of suggestions depends on the LLM model used
